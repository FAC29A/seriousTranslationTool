## 2 Jason's Think Hole

### 2A The Idea

#### 2A1 Theme

##### 2A1A Seeds

###### 2A1A1 Me Likey

- [ ] Which god you should worship based on your values/ethical beliefs
- [ ] Correlations between:
	- minority first language speakers
	- socioeconomic outcomes
	- national/regional policies towards those languages
- [ ] Attitudes of people speaking a particular language towards speakers of other languages correlated with degree of relatedness between those languages
	- [ ] Catalan, Castilian, Occitan, French & Basque would be a great test case
- [ ] Historical Event Lifetime Extrapolator
	- Pick a historical event.
	- Imagine an unnamed participant in that event.
	- Define how old they were at the time
	- App displays what other events they experienced in their lifetime

###### 2A1A2 Maybe

- [ ] Enter how you want to insult someone. Return an idiom translated from another language
- [ ] Who was the first recorded named person from your town
- [ ] Something to do with MBTI personality typology?
- [ ] Dodgiest research papers on a subject of your choice
- [ ] North-South Hemisphere Holiday Translator
- [ ] Crap Pseudo-Science Aggregator
- [ ] Kinship terms within a language correlated with expressed attitudes towards social norms
	- [ ] Could go a little bit too Sapir-Whorf

###### 2A1A3 Absolutely Not

- [ ] Quotes from religious texts to help you justify horrible shit you want to do
- [ ] Could Genghis Khan beat up a shark?
- [ ] Analyse the emotional tone & sentiment of text, but the analysis is really judgemental

###### 2A1A4 Inbox

- [ ] Politician Dewaffler
- [ ] Venn Diagram Generator of Obscure Musical Subgenres (wat iz a vaporwave)
- [ ] Right Wing Catastrophism Analyser
- [ ] Awful Hot Take Generator
- [ ] Word Expander
	- Apply pre-existing affixes to any word in order to convey new meaning
	- Possibly separately input desired extra meaning not conveyed by root word
	- Possibly can weight likelihood of older or newer affixes to convey sense of when word was coined
	- e.g. adjectival form of politician, add connotation of "fool", skew towards Middle English affixes
- [ ] Last time a newspaper printed a given slur word without quotation marks. Maybe correlated with attitudes towards current social issues?
- [ ] Uncomfortable Recommendations
- [ ] Weird Shit Your Country Believes
